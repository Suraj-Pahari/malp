# ALP solutions of old Pokhara University Questions

## 8086 MASM

### Questions:

> **NOTE:** Question 3, 7, 8 needs HEX to correct ASCII (or vice versa) adjustment to print correct characters/numbers on the DOS screen if using DOSBOX. However when using an emulator they'll work just fine (hopefully **finger-crossed** :P).

1. Write 8086 masm to print "Hello World". [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/1.asm)
2. Write a program to print "Pokhara University" character-wise using macro to insert space between characters. [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/2.asm)
3. Write a program in 8086 masm to find sum of two numbers given my user as input and display sum on screen. [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/3.asm)
4. Write an ALP for 8086 to compare two strings and display "Same" if they are same else print "Not Same". [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/4.asm)
5. Write an ALP for 8086 to print "Microprocessor Programming" from string data "Microprocessor and Assembly Language Programming". [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/5.asm)
6. Write an procedure program for 8086 to print newline and use it to display 3 different strings in different lines. [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/6.asm)
7. Write an ALP for 8086 to find 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ..... + n^2 where n is given by user. [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/7.asm)
8. Write an ALP for 8086 to calculate square root of a number given that the number is perfect square of two digit. [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/8.asm)
9. Write an ALP for 8086 to copy one string from one location to another. [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/9.asm)
10. Write an ALP for 8086 to copy 16 bytes of data from D000h to E000h. [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/10.asm)
11. Write an ALP for 8086 to find factorial of a number. [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/11.asm)
12. Write an ALP for 8086 to find whether a number is positive or negative. [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/12.asm)
13. Write an ALP for 8086 to take string input from user and display it in DOS screen. [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/13.asm)
14. Write an ALP for 8086 to reverse a string given by the user. [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/14.asm)
15. Write an ALP for 8086 to find the smallest & biggest number from an array. [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/15.asm)
16. Write an ALP for 8086 to find square of a number. [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/16.asm)
17. Write an ALP for 8086 to copy an array to another array in reverse order. [open](https://github.com/shivajichalise/malp/blob/main/8086/17.asm)

> Question 10 is should be theoratically correct program but you may face errors because of trying to access memory locations manually. However if you were to write a program using array of length 16 for 16 bytes of data transfer (like in question 17) it'd be logical.
