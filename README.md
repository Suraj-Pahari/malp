> **NOTE:** Question 3, 7, 8 needs HEX to correct ASCII (or vice versa) adjustment to print correct characters/numbers on the DOS screen if using DOSBOX. However when using an emulator they'll work just fine (hopefully **finger-crossed** :P).
> Question 10 is should be theoratically correct program but you may face errors because of trying to access memory locations manually. However if you were to do write a program using array of length 16 for 16 bytes of data transfer (like in question 17) it'll work great.
